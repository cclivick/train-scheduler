## Main Concept
This is an application which utilizes firebase to store user data and display updated information on scheduled train arrivals. Users have the ability to add their own trains by submitting a name, destination, a first departure time, and the frequency of the train's arrivals. This information is stored remotely and the page updates once every minute to inform users when the next trains will arrive.

## Technologies Used
For styling and formatting, I used standard HTML and CSS, as well as Bootstrap for mobile responsiveness. Script was written using jQuery, and utilizes both firebase for remote data storage and moment.js for minute-to-minute updates.
